# Grade Tracker
<h2>App Purpose</h2>
<p>The purpose of this application is to help students track how well they are doing in their courses. 
When you login, you can add a course, and in each course you can add any amount of grades as well as the overall weight of the grades. 
When you select a course, you will see a list of all your grades, and your current grade in that course. 
This will be very useful for students because sometimes it is hard to get an idea of how well you are doing in your courses with all your assignments and tests having different weights, so having a quick way to figure out your exact grade is very helpful.</p>

<h2>Changes since Assignment 2</h2>
<p>For assignment 2, I have added functionality in the grades class. You can now add grades to an assignment, and you can click on each grade, which will display a toast of the mark and weight. I couldn't fully implement the grade breakdown after a whole lot of trying, but it does mostly work minus the part I commented out that would not work. I also improved the visals by increasing some button sizes and changing the layout of the grades scene.</p>
